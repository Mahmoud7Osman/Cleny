C Test Functions aims to provide an easy and simple way of testing C projects.
The unit tests are included directly in the files next to the tested behavior.
The tests are run by the `ceeteef` program on the compiled executable. Other
than the tests themselves, you need not write anything new.

NAMING
======

I called the command `ceeteef` rather than `ctf` because `ctf` seemed like a
short name for a non-essential command.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

This is meant for POSIX systems, specifically POSIX.1-2001. This includes, at
least for now, the `nm` command.

I think it would be possible to port it to Windows (without using a Unix
emulator,) but I have not the knowledge, the motivation, nor the computer.

USAGE
=====

Running `make` creates the executable.

Install the command with `make install` or by manually copying the manual pages,
the header, and the executable into your preferred directories.

To write a test, include the `libctf.h` header in the `lib` directory. Now write
a test:

CTF_TEST(test_name,
	printf("testing...");
	assert(1 + 1 == 3);
)

This will only exist when the symbol CTF_TESTS_ENABLED is defined. If so, a
static function with the name `test_name` is created, so you can't reuse the
name. The executable `ceeteef` depends on test symbols in your program existing
in the compiled version, so make sure symbols are exported by default in
whatever way possible. This may require adding the `-shared` option, i.e.,
making a shared library.

Now run the tests:

 $ ceeteef YOUR-EXECUTABLE
-- test_name --
test_name:testing...
test_name:Assertion failed: (1 + 1 == 3), function test_name, file test.c, line 3.
test_name FAILED   Terminated by signal 6   Core dumped

For further information, consult the man pages `ceeteef.1` and `ctf.3` or the
help information from `ceeteef -h`. A practical example of this framework's
usage can be seen with my project 'ts3d', located at github.com/TurkeyMcMac/ts3d

OUTPUT PARSING
==============

I didn't add a whole lot of built-in output switches because I figure that's the
Unix way or something. The output is fairly easy to parse.

All of the following scripts, except the last one, can have styles enabled with
`ceeteef`'s -s option. Replace TESTS in these examples with the name of your
compiled test file.

Listing all output of just the failing tests:

 $ ceeteef TESTS | awk '/^-/{o=""}{o=o$0"\n"}/^[^- ]+ [^ ]*FAIL/{printf"%s",o}'

Listing only test outcomes:

 $ ceeteef TESTS | grep -Ev '^--|^[[:alnum:]_]+:'

Listing only test failure outcomes:

 $ ceeteef TESTS | grep -Ev '^--|^[[:alnum:]_]+:|SUCCEEDED'

Finally, here is a more complex script. It writes the output from each test into
its own file in the directory 'logs'. The file is named after the test function.
Here it is, in all its hideousness:

ceeteef TESTS | sed '
	s/'\''/'"'\\\\''"'/g
	s/^\([^-: ]\{1,\}\)[: ]\(.*\)$/printf %s\\\\n '\''\2'\'' >> logs\/\1/
	s/^-- \([^ ]\{1,\}\) --$/rm -f logs\/\1/
' | sh
