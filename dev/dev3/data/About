Art,  game  design, and  programming  by
Jude Melton-Houghton.

In making  this game,  I set out  not to
make a game, but to design a system. The
external  libraries I  used  so far  are
only the C Standard Library, Curses, and
a  bunch of  stuff  from  POSIX 2001  or
so.  I  myself  wrote  the  JSON  parser
(called json,)  the 3D  renderer (called
d3d,) and the  testing framework (called
ctf.)  The language being C,  I also had
to  reimplement  a bunch of basic  stuff
such as dynamic arrays and dictionaries.

I  have tried  to  make  most game  data
configurable   with  JSON   rather  than
hard-coded.  I'm pretty  happy with  how
things  have  so   far  turned  out.  If
you  know  the   location  of  the  data
directory,  you can  view  and edit  all
the textures, entities,  and maps, along
with  menus  and  texts like  this  one.
The  README in  the  data directory  has
detailed  documentation.   If  you  have
the  source  code (hosted  currently  at
github.com/TurkeyMcMac/ts3d) you can use
an executable  called 'texture'  to view
textures or print out  a table to assist
with  creating new  ones. For  textures,
each character  in the  file corresponds
to a pixel color.

I tried to make this text pretty long so
that I could admire my implementation of
scrolling the text across the screen.
